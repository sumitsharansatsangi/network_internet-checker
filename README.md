# network_internet_checker

The [connectivity](https://pub.dev/packages/connectivity) package and other similar packages only
provides information if there is a network connection, but not if the network is connected to 
the Internet. That's why the 
[network_internet_c hecker](https://github.com/Ogunleye-Similoluwa/network_internet-checker) package
helps you easily manage widgets dynamically based on the device's internet access.
